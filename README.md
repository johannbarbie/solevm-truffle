![EVM Enforcer](https://i.imgur.com/V9EGql2.png)

The **EVM Enforcer** is a computation verification engine that allows on-chain enforcement of off-chain EVM execution. 

![Process Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/o1FRMqp.png)

Anyone who solved some off-chain execution can register a result with the *Enforcer contract*. A challenge period starts during which challengers can open disputes over the presented results. Disputes are delegated to the *Verifier contract* where solver and challenger play an interactive execution verification game. If the challenger wins, the execution results are deleted and the solver looses a bond. If the solver is able to defend the execution results throughout the challenge period, the result is accepted.


## FAQ

- **What is the relationship to solEVM?**
The EVM enforcer is built on [Andreas Olofsson](https://github.com/androlo)'s [solEVM](https://github.com/Ohalo-Ltd/solevm). Thank you Andreas :clap: !
- **How is this different than Truebit?**
[Truebit](http://truebit.io)'s interactive computation verification game uses a [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) VM. We allow to run EVM bytecode. 
- **What do you use this for?**
We use this to enforce the correctness of transaction in [Plasma Leap](https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-leap-a-state-enabled-computing-model-for-plasma/3539).

## Setup

Currently there are only tests using truffle. You can run the tests like this:

```
yarn
yarn test
```

## Runtime - EVMRuntime.sol

The runtime contract is `EVMRuntime.sol`. The contract is designed with extensibility in mind.
The most basic contract which makes use of it is [EthereumRuntime.sol](https://github.com/leapdao/solEVM-enforcer/blob/master/contracts/EVMRuntime.sol),
the contract has an `execute` function which is used to run code.

Other contracts which makes use of the `EVMRuntime` are:
- [Verifier.sol](https://github.com/leapdao/solEVM-enforcer/blob/master/contracts/Verifier.sol)


## Off-chain Interpreter & Merkelizer | Based on ethereumjs-vm :clap:

It also exists a corresponding runtime implementation on the JS side.
[You can take a look at the on-chain Verifier unit test on how it's used.](https://github.com/leapdao/solEVM-enforcer/blob/master/test/verifier.js)

[The OffchainStepper mimics the EthereumRuntime contract](https://github.com/leapdao/solEVM-enforcer/blob/master/utils/OffchainStepper.js)
and together with the [Merkelizer](https://github.com/leapdao/solEVM-enforcer/blob/master/utils/Merkelizer.js),
creates a Merkle Root of the individual execution steps (before and after each opcode) given `code`, `data` and other runtime properties.

The `OffchainStepper` & `Merkelizer` are *WIP* too, as they get further improved and refactored to get closer to the `EVMRuntime` class model.

For the curious, there is also a [off-chain Dispute mock-implementation](https://github.com/leapdao/solEVM-enforcer/blob/master/utils/DisputeMock.js),
with the same logic like the on-chain `Verifier` contract.


#### Work In Progress

The design decision that the `EVMRuntime.sol` will be the base 'class' for contracts needing a runtime environment is final,
though the whole interface design is not final yet.

It is planned that the `struct EVM` will hold a pointer to memory where users can point to their custom data / structure,
this property gives the most flexibility for developers working with the `EVMRuntime` without hitting contract size-, maximal stack depth or other limitations.


### Blockchain

There are no blocks, so `BLOCKHASH` will always return `0`. The only blockchain related parameters that can be set are those in the context object.
