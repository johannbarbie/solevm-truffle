# How to create a new bounty?

1. Create an issue with bounty description and bounty and draft tags in an appropriate repository.

   If the bounty spans across multiple repositories, consider splitting it in a smaller per-repo bounties if possible.
   The bounty definition should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time bound)
2. Submit proposal via the bounty form: http://bounty.leapdao.org/viewform
3. Add the bounty to the bounties board: https://github.com/orgs/leapdao/projects/6
